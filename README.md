# Simon-Game
This is a simon game coded by me for javascript practice purpose

In the Simon game, players must replicate a sequence of colors or sounds. The game starts with a single color or sound, and the player must reproduce it. Then, the game adds another element to the sequence, and the player must repeat the entire sequence in the correct order. This pattern continues, with the sequence growing longer and more complex each time. Players have a limited time to reproduce each sequence correctly. Making a mistake ends the game. The goal is to achieve the highest score by accurately replicating the longest possible sequence. The game tests memory, pattern recognition, and concentration skills.
